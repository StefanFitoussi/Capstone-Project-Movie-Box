# Movie-Box

## Capstone Project of the Web Development bootcamp at neuefische

"Movie-Box" helps the user to decide what to possibly watch next within a pool of given cinematic selections. It is a fetch tool for information about a certain range of movies, where the user can take a look at different film lists, get more details about specific movies and store them in a watchlist.

From the landing page the user has direct access to the "popular"-list of 20 movies from the API of The MovieDB by scrolling down. Each movie has a poster-image, an ADD/REMOVE-button and displays the respective user-rating. A click an the image shows further details about a movie such as the release-date und the plot-overview.

On top of the landing page is the selection of different movie lists for display. A click on one of the other options displays the respective list. The user can access these movies by scolling down.

A click on the ADD-button adds a movie to the watchlist, which can be accesses by clicking the "LIST"-button at the bottom of the screen. A click on the REMOVE-button removed a from the watchlist. This can be do from the watchlist, as well the landing page. The number of movies to store in the watchlist ist not limited.
